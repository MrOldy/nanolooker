# Nano Browserquest item guide

This is a guide to all of the items that you can find in NBQ, their basic stats, where to find them and how common/rare they are.

Most items have a unique version with better/more stats. Weapons, armors & belts all have unique counterparts. There is a 1% chance of receiving a unique version when an item is dropped. Amulets and rings do not have counterparts, but instead have what is categorized as "super-uniques" in this guide. These are very rare items with attributes that are unique to them specifically.

The items are listed in order of stats (Low - High) with exception for super uniques as they have attributes which are useful in different situations and cannot be ranked.

Items can be upgraded by using the anvil in the village. The attributes described in this guide are for level 1 items. As an item is upgraded, all stats will get a higher number.
