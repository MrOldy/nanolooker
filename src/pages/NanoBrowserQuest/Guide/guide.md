# Nano Browserquest item guide

This is a guide to all of the items that you can find in NBQ, their basic stats, where to find them and how common/rare they are.

Most items have a unique version with better/more stats. Weapons, armors & belts all have unique counterparts. Amulets and rings do not have counterparts, but instead have what is categorized as "super-uniques" in this guide. These are very rare items with attributes that are unique to them specifically.

The items are listed in order of stats (Low - High) with exception for super uniques as they have attributes which are useful in different situations and cannot be ranked.

The upgraded item (if successful) will emerge in the right square.
